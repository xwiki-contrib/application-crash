There's an existing integration of CRaSH into XWiki available here: http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/CRaSH+Console

The purpose of this new version is to:
* Use a new version of CRaSH
* Use a different way to integrate it (as suggested by its creator Julien Viet)
* Focus initially on just providing a SSH access to the CRaSH console
* Allow adding new CRaSH commands in wiki pages
